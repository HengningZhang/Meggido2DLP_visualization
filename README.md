<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is the course project for **CS-6703 Computational Geometry** under guidance of *[Prof. Boris Aronov](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/boris-aronov)* at **NYU Tandon School of Engineering**.


### The Algorithm

Megiddo's algorithm is a deterministic linear programming algorithm that runs in O(n) time designed by *[Dr Nimrod Megiddo](http://theory.stanford.edu/~megiddo/bio.html)*.
<br>
I am implementing its 2D straight line version for my project.
The algorithm does the following things:
1. Pair the lower constraints arbitrarily and calculate intersection point for each pair
2. Find the median x value of the paired intersections
3. Deploy a vertical test line at the median x value, get top lower constraint(s) and bottom upper constraint(s). In the following content of the report I will used their abbreviations--TLC and BUC.
4. Discard one constraint every pair for half of the intersecting pairs, depending on the information returned by the test line.
5. Do 1-4 again, but with constraints on the other side
<br>
By doing these steps, we get a recurrence that can be written like: T(n)=T(7/8n)+O(n), which is a decreasing geometric series that sums up to O(n).

### Implementation Details
Technically speaking the whole project should have been divided into a implementation part and a visualization part, but I did them together to make the process easier for me.

I split the steps to these smaller functions:
- `median()`:get the median from an array of numbers
- `draw()`,`onmousedown()`,`onmouseup()`,`onmousemove()` are the functions that allow drawing on the board. 
- `process_line()`: takes the coordinates of two points and returns (a,b) after calculating the line in y=ax+b form.
- `get_full_line()`: calculates the segment to be displayed on the board (extends to the boundary of the board).
- `calculate_intersection()` that calculates the intersection point of two lines.
- `test_line()` 1) deploys the test line that returns the TLC(s) and BUC(s); 2) draws the test line and Highlight TLC and BUC with different colors on the board.
<br>
For the lower constraints:

- `pair()`: pairs the remaining lower constraints arbitrarily.
- `update()`: clears the board and then draws the current subproblem (all the remaining constraints).
- `update_pair()`: draws intersection of the current pairs on the board.
- `update_discard()`: draws 1) the intersection points of the pairs that will have one of the constraints discarded 2) the constraints that are discarded in the current iteration
- `get_median_intersection()`: finds the median x value of the pairsâ€™ intersections.
- `discard_left()` and `discard_right()`: discard half of the constraints on one side, 
- `discard_constraints()`:takes the result of test_line() and uses the TLC and BUC to determine which discard function to call.
<br>
For upper constraints, there is a similar set of functions that includes `_upper` in their function names.

- `brute_force()` calculates the optimal point when both sides have <= 5 constraints remaining.
- `step_lower()` calls `discard_lower()` and handles the displays if there are more than 5 lower constraints remaining. `step_upper()` does the same thing, but with upper constraints.
- `step()` is the function that triggers when the run button in index.html is pressed, it determines which side to process, displays result if optimal point if found or does not exist and displays console messages.

### Unexpected Difficulties and Complications
- When dealing with both sides of the constraints, it is not sufficient to deal with one side after dealing with another. Because `test_line()` costs O(#remaining constraints) and not alternating would make `step()` cost quadratic time.
- At first, I wanted to display every paired intersections on the board. However, as the intersection coordinates can be far away outside the board, I decide not to display them. This visualization is only focusing on the intersections inside this board and only the inputs that make the intersections inside the board will display a better visual presentation of the algorithm.
- There are some edge cases with `test_line()`, namingly when there are multiple TLCs or multiple BUCs.
  - If in feasible region, multiple BUCs does not affect the decision
    - If multiple TLCs, an early detection of the optimal point may happen when there is at least one TLC with positive derivative and another with negative derivative at test line, because local minimum is global minimum in straight line linear programming problem.
    - ![early-optimal][early-optimal]
  - If not in feasible region
    - if there are multiple TLCs
      - The side where feasible region may exist can be determined by comparing min(TLC') to max(BUC') (highest TLC and lowest BUC on the left) and max(TLC') to min(BUC') (highest TLC and lowest BUC on the right). If min(TLC') > max(BUC'), it means at some x value to the left, the lower constraint with a=min(TLC') will be below the upper constraint with a=min(BUC'), thus there might be a feasible region on the left, so it is safe to discard on right. Vise versa with max(TLC') < min(BUC').
      - ![edge-case-for-upper-multiple-TLC_2][upper-multiple-tlc-2]
      - In this case no feasible region exists be cause neither min(TLC') > max(BUC') or max(TLC') < min(BUC') is true. This means the top lower constraints are constraining the feasible region in a convex region strickly above bottom lower constraints so no feasible region exists.
    - If ther are mltiple BUCs:
      - As we are already using max(BUC') and min(BUC') in the case of dealing with multiple TLCs, they are already taken care of.
- The console messages are also causing some confusions. Now I really understand why we need those UIUX guys. I respect them totally now.

### Built With
* [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [HTML](https://html.com/)

### My Own Work
- Codes/Tools from online 
  - `median()`: a tiny function that calls JavaScript's built in sorting function.
  - `draw()`,`onmousedown()`,`onmouseup()`,`onmousemove()`and `canvas` component of `index.html`: the functions and web component that enables the drawing effects is from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49885020/drawing-a-straight-line-using-mouse-events-on-canvas-in-javascript. As you can see by following the link, it is a very basic drawing board. It does not even provide functions to store the lines as coefficients. 
  - This README template, `Best-README-Template`, from [https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template).
  - Deployment of the webapp by GitHub Pages.
- Understanding the algorithm
  - homework materials by *[Prof. Boris Aronov](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/boris-aronov)* at **NYU Tandon School of Engineering**.
  - course notes by *[Prof. Greg Aloupis](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/greg-aloupis)* at **NYU Tandon School of Engineering**.
- The rest of the project is my own work, including parsing and storing the input, implmentation of all the steps in Megiddo's algorithm and visualization of the step results on HTML canvas.
